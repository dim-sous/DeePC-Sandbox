name: plain
description: Say the last answer again in plain language and compactly. The developer does not remember this codebase (2026-11-10) and is not a software engineer, but reads mathematics and control theory; an explanation that only makes sense to someone who already knows the code has not explained anything.
when_to_use: The developer asks to re-explain, says an answer was too long or too dense, asks "what do you mean?" or "what am I supposed to understand from this?", or types /plain.

# Say it again, plainly

Re-explain what was just said. Same content, different words — this is not a summary and not a
new answer: nothing is dropped, nothing new is added, no hedging is introduced.

## What to change

- **Plain words.** Name the thing by what it does, not by what it is called. "A registry is the
  one list a choice is made from, like a menu: the plants are picked from it by name." Say the
  jargon term once if the developer will meet it again on screen, then use the plain words.
- **Mathematics keeps its terms.** Plain is for software and codebase jargon, not for maths. A
  mathematical object is named by its standard term, with its parameters: "a block-Hankel
  matrix of depth L = Tini + N", not "the data table".
- **Compact.** Short sentences. No preamble, no restating the question, no closing summary of
  the summary. If a table says it in four rows, use four rows.
- **Lead with the answer.** The finding first, then why, then what it means for the work. Never
  build up to it.
- **Concrete over abstract.** A command they can type, a number that was measured, a file they
  can open — not a description of a category of thing.

## What must survive

- **Every number keeps its conditions.** A measurement without what it was measured under is
  not plainer, it is wrong.
- **Uncertainty stays uncertain.** If something was not verified, the plain version still says
  it was not verified. Simplifying is not the same as becoming confident.
- **Any correction stays.** If the original said "I was wrong about X", so does this one.
- **Their decision stays theirs.** If the original ended with a choice for the developer, the
  plain version ends with the same choice, not with a recommendation dressed as a conclusion.

## Check before sending

Could someone who has never opened this repository follow it? If a sentence only parses for
someone who already knows the code, it has not been re-explained — it has been re-typed.
